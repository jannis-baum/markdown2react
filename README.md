# markdown2react aka markdown2next

Parse Markdown to create live React / NextJS components!

This project is in early development and aims at providing an easy way of maintaining React / NextJS websites that rely on Markdown files for their content.

For reference, complete Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). In addition to traditional Markdown features, this parser intends to section content based on headings and to provide additional vital features such as image galleries.

See issues for development progress.
